Our research-grade GLP-2 (T*) is manufactured in ISO 9001:2015 certified facilities using advanced solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) technology, ensuring consistent quality and structural integrity for demanding laboratory applications.\n\nGLP peptides are incretin hormones derived from proglucagon, playing crucial roles in glucose homeostasis and intestinal function.\n\n### Scientific Background\nGlucagon-like peptides (GLPs) are a family of incretin hormones derived from the post-translational processing of proglucagon. These peptides play crucial roles in glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, and gastrointestinal function.\n\nGLP receptor agonists have been extensively studied for their effects on glucose-dependent insulin secretion, glucagon suppression, gastric emptying, and satiety signaling. Research has explored their potential in metabolic regulation and cellular proliferation pathways.\n\n### Research Applications\nGLP-2 (T*) is utilized in various research contexts including:\n\n- Glucose metabolism research\n- Insulin secretion studies\n- Intestinal growth and repair\n- Appetite regulation research\n- Metabolic syndrome investigations\n- Diabetes research models\n- Gut hormone signaling\n- Neuroprotection studies\n\n### Product Specifications\n- **Purity**: >98% (verified by HPLC)\n- **Form**: Lyophilized Powder\n- **Storage**: Store at -20\u00b0C\n- **Molecular Formula**: Variable by specific analog\n- **Molecular Weight**: See specific product COA\n- **CAS Number**: Compound-specific\n- **Sequence**: Modified GLP sequence\n\n### Quality Assurance\nEvery batch of GLP-2 (T*) undergoes rigorous quality control:\n\n\u2713 **Third-Party HPLC Analysis** - Independent verification of purity and composition\n\u2713 **Mass Spectrometry** - Confirms exact molecular weight and structure\n\u2713 **Certificate of Analysis (COA)** - Available for every batch, published openly\n\u2713 **Endotoxin Testing** - Ensures research-grade cleanliness (<1.0 EU/mg)\n\u2713 **Sterility Verification** - Tested for bacterial/fungal contamination\n\n### Shipping & Handling\n- **Same-Day Dispatch**: Orders placed before 2 PM EST ship same day\n- **Cold Chain Logistics**: Temperature-controlled packaging with gel ice packs\n- **Domestic Shipping**: 1-3 business days (USA)\n- **International Shipping**: Available where permitted by local regulations\n- **Tracking Provided**: Full tracking information for all shipments\n\n### Reconstitution Guidelines\nFor optimal research results, GLP-2 (T*) should be reconstituted following these guidelines:\n1. Use bacteriostatic water (0.9% benzyl alcohol) or sterile water for injection\n2. Recommended concentration: 0.5-1 mg/mL\n3. Add water slowly to the vial wall, not directly on the lyophilized powder\n4. Gently swirl the vial - avoid vigorous shaking which may damage the peptide\n5.

    "description": "## StaRter Kit R - Premium Research-Grade Peptide\n\n### Overview\nStaRter Kit R is a research-grade peptide supplied by Premier Bio Labs with verified >98% purity through independent third-party HPLC testing. Our research-grade StaRter Kit R is manufactured in ISO 9001:2015 certified facilities using advanced solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) technology, ensuring consistent quality and structural integrity for demanding laboratory applications.\n\nStaRter Kit R is a high-purity research peptide provided for laboratory investigations.\n\n### Scientific Background\nStaRter Kit R is supplied as a lyophilized powder with >98% purity verified by HPLC analysis. This research-grade peptide is manufactured under strict quality control standards.\n\n### Research Applications\nStaRter Kit R is utilized in various research contexts including:\n\n- General peptide research\n- Biochemical assays\n- Cell culture studies\n- Protein interaction studies\n\n### Product Specifications\n- **Purity**: >98% (verified by HPLC)\n- **Form**: Lyophilized Powder\n- **Storage**: Store at -20\u00b0C\n- **Molecular Formula**: See Certificate of Analysis\n- **Molecular Weight**: See Certificate of Analysis\n- **CAS Number**: Available upon request\n- **Sequence**: See product documentation\n\n### Quality Assurance\nEvery batch of StaRter Kit R undergoes rigorous quality control:\n\n\u2713 **Third-Party HPLC Analysis** - Independent verification of purity and composition\n\u2713 **Mass Spectrometry** - Confirms exact molecular weight and structure\n\u2713 **Certificate of Analysis (COA)** - Available for every batch, published openly\n\u2713 **Endotoxin Testing** - Ensures research-grade cleanliness (<1.0 EU/mg)\n\u2713 **Sterility Verification** - Tested for bacterial/fungal contamination\n\n### Shipping & Handling\n- **Same-Day Dispatch**: Orders placed before 2 PM EST ship same day\n- **Cold Chain Logistics**: Temperature-controlled packaging with gel ice packs\n- **Domestic Shipping**: 1-3 business days (USA)\n- **International Shipping**: Available where permitted by local regulations\n- **Tracking Provided**: Full tracking information for all shipments\n\n### Reconstitution Guidelines\nFor optimal research results, StaRter Kit R should be reconstituted following these guidelines:\n1. Use bacteriostatic water (0.9% benzyl alcohol) or sterile water for injection\n2. Recommended concentration: 1 mg/mL\n3. Add water slowly to the vial wall, not directly on the lyophilized powder\n4. Gently swirl the vial - avoid vigorous shaking which may damage the peptide\n5. Allow 5-10 minutes for complete dissolution\n6. Once reconstituted, store at 2-8\u00b0C and use within 4 weeks at 2-8\u00b0C\n\n### Handling Precautions\n- Use aseptic techniques when handling\n- Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles\n- Protect from light and moisture\n- Use calibrated micropipettes for accurate dosing\n- Document batch numbers for research reproducibility\n\n### Research Compliance Notice\n\u26a0\ufe0f **IMPORTANT**: StaRter Kit R is strictly for *in vitro* laboratory research use only. This product is **NOT** approved by the FDA for human consumption, therapeutic use, or veterinary applications. Not for use in humans or animals. Researchers must comply with all applicable institutional guidelines and regulations.
