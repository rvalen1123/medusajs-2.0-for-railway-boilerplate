## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Build fails without WooCommerce connection** - The `generateStaticParams` function tries to fetch products at build time. This is expected and will work when deployed with proper WooCommerce connection.

2. **Import warning for `getProductsListWithSort`** - Not related to product page redesign. This is in the store page and needs to be addressed separately.

## 💡 Tips

### For Developers
- The layout uses Tailwind CSS utility classes (no custom CSS needed)
- All components are server components except ProductActions (needs client interactivity)
- Images are optimized with Next.js Image component
- Tabs use Radix UI for accessibility

### For Content Managers
- Add product metadata in WooCommerce custom fields
- Use high-quality images (at least 800x1000px)
- Write compelling product descriptions
- Add highlights that emphasize benefits
- Include specifications for technical products
- Upload COA certificates for peptides

### For Testing
- Test with products that have 1 image, 2-3 images, and 4+ images
- Test with products that have variants (size, color)
- Test with products with and without COA
- Use Chrome DevTools device emulator for mobile testing
- Check console for any errors
