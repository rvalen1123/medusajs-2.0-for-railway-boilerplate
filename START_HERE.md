## 🎯 Quick Decision Tree

### Are you ready to clean up NOW?

**YES** → Follow this order:
1. Read `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` (5 min)
2. Read `CLEANUP_PLAN.md` (15 min)
3. Backup everything
4. Run `./cleanup-script.sh`
5. Follow Phase 1 in CLEANUP_PLAN.md
6. Deploy to Vercel (Phase 4)

**NO, want to understand first** → Read this order:
1. `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Understand what changed
2. `WOOCOMMERCE_SETUP.md` - How WooCommerce is set up
3. `CLEANUP_PLAN.md` - What needs to be done
4. `BEST_PRACTICES.md` - How to improve code quality

**NO, just getting started** → Do this:
1. `QUICK_START_NEW.md` - Get development environment running
2. Test WooCommerce: `cd storefront && npm run test:woo`
3. Run locally: `npm run dev:local`
4. Come back when ready to clean up

## 💡 What's Currently Happening

### ✅ What's Working (KEEP)
- Next.js storefront with WooCommerce integration
- Products loading from WooCommerce
- Cart management via CoCart
- B2BKing B2B features
- Customer authentication

### ❌ What's Not Needed (REMOVE)
- Entire MedusaJS backend (`/backend` folder)
- 9+ Railway services (Backend, Worker, Redis, Postgres, etc.)
- MedusaJS dependencies
- Old documentation

### 💰 Cost Savings
- **Before:** $120/month (Railway + MedusaJS infrastructure)
- **After:** $20/month (Just Vercel)
- **Savings:** $100/month = $1,200/year!

- [ ] Deploy to Vercel staging (don't delete Railway yet!)

### Week 2: Code Cleanup
- [ ] Run `./cleanup-script.sh`
- [ ] Remove MedusaJS dependencies
- [ ] Update environment variables
- [ ] Test everything still works

### Week 3: Best Practices
- [ ] Implement error handling (see BEST_PRACTICES.md)
- [ ] Add monitoring (Sentry, Analytics)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Add proper caching

### Week 4: Production & Infrastructure Cleanup
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel production

## 🚨 Important Warnings

### DO NOT delete Railway services until:
1. ✅ Vercel deployment is stable
2. ✅ You've tested all features in production
3. ✅ You've monitored for at least 1 week
4. ✅ You have backups of any important data

### DO backup before cleaning:
- Export WordPress/WooCommerce data
- Screenshot Railway settings
- Backup any custom code
- The cleanup script creates backups automatically
